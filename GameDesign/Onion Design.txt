Onion Design

Identify your core feature and start there and work your way outward where features deacrease in importance.

Test: (write down the most important features of ProjectBoost)
1. Spaceship controls (feel of movements, speed, inertia, gravity, manageable)
2. Obstacles (hitboxes make sense/feels right based on visuals)
3. Level design (provide a challenge with getting from A to B, increasing in difficulty as levels increase)



By using this method you can answer some questions which often come up as you design you game
here are some examples:

What features should I include in my game?
Where should i start development?
What are my priorities?
What if I run out of time?
When should I stop?
